present: nanomonkey, mixmix, cft, kevin

## Agenda

- [x] updates
  - radio seminar
- [x] documentation
- [x] firmware repo
- [x] JS API (mix)


## Updates

CFT
- radio seminar (with students)
  - modulation, error correcting codes
  - school projects
    - classic modem, fast fourier transform
    - walkie talkie with esp32! (VHF tiny-ssb modem?!)
- student working on mini-app
  - working on documentation
  - mix: keen 
  
Mix
- have not progressed JS API
- tried the firmware, feels blocked, keen to help progressed
- didn't make progress on documenting side-chain


Nano
- blocked on documentation of firmware


Kevin
- have ordered 2 Meshtastic boards
  - LILYGO T-Beam Meshtastic LORA32 915MHz ESP32 TTGO Development Board WiFi BLE CH9102F 
- keen to help, give me tasks
- need to get an android device?
  - CFT: Note currently you need 2 Android devices, as these are the only ones which can write. I think this suggests we should consider another application which can write (e.g. TyChi's watch app)
  - Mix: could also consider extending the Python App
  - Mix: TyChi also pointed out Tauri route to iPhone/ Android
- helping out on a conference called 
  - governance, philosophy, ...

  - driven by Danielle Johnstone



## Documentation

- Mix: keen for this to progress, supports iterations
- CFT: agree
- nanomonkey: the firmware code ... the C++ code is hard to follow... is the python code a good source
- Mix: keen to progress this, have a clear goal. Can we set a date + commitments to get this done?
- CFT: I'm probably out for a couple weeks
- nanomonkey: It'd be a big help to have a pointer to any docs, recommended source
- CFT: I think pairing would help progress these
  - looking though code for definitions
  - pairing with Mix to sort our T-Beam snags
- CFT: here's a piece https://github.com/tschudin/tinyssb
  - Mix + Nano: to review and keep notes for conversation


## Firmware Repo

Story so far:
- splitting out the firmware repo
- some testing of the install guide
- we decided
  - not using the IDE to install things, libraries vendoring
  - working on main/master branch
- TODO:
  - Mix try the `main` branch
  - https://github.com/tinySSB/esp32-firmware



## JS API

- Mix: this is about aiming to split out
  - sending things into the backend
  - listening to messages
- Mix: not sure how to progress
- CFT: I think the documentation coming from my student will progress this
- CFT: how does this interface with "mini-app"?
- Mix: I think that's a layer of abstraction above, and a different spec. Happy to look at that too once we have stability at this level.

- Nanomonkey: would be great to have
  - post a message of specific type
  - subscriptions for messages of specific types
  - querying the database
    - messages of specific type 
    - get specific message?
    - triple-store query?
