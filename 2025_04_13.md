## Agenda

- [x] Intros / check-in
- [x] Sharing updates
- [x] Repos
- [x] Spec work
- [ ] Device support
- [ ] Mini Apps
- [ ] Calendaring

## Updates

- mix: talked with cft, spec progressed, to be continued
- mix: talked with Piet - he's interested in Rust implementation
- mix: talked with Glyph, working with PeerToPanda; using tinySSB for elder people (Assisted living)?
- mix: talked with Adam on miniApps
- cft: Adam to create a complete "How to" for MiniApps, the "Wuff" app (one button, one updateable display field, nothing else) as complete code
- cft: next week the student project kickoff will take place, real student work will be May, June July, miniapp suggestions to the students include "poll/vote", "blog", "games", "(offline) map"
- cft: started T5s3pro for the ESP32-branch of TinySSB, toolchain now works, first init code
  - https://lilygo.cc/products/t5-e-paper-s3-pro
- kevin: not sure where to start, keen for some direction
  - nano: currently the esp32 is all in C++
  - org: https://github.com/tinySSB/ 
  - esp32 code: https://github.com/tinySSB/esp32-firmware
- kevin: have t5, one on way to nano. have meshtastic, esp32

## Repos

- nano: where is work for the t5?
  - cft: I'll put it in https://github.com/tinySSB/esp32-firmware

- mix: interested in which repos we're using
  - mix: e.g. the crashing android app
  - cft: these will go into the new org. There are a few piece of work from students that we don't want to lose. we can close that old one once we've done this
  - cft: our policy for updating code might need to be different in different places - e.g. more disciplined PRs in new org
    - mix: intersted to know if we should have one "main" source repo + forks off that.
    - nano: main question would be "is there work in here we'd like to merge into our main repo?"
      - cft: I had to rework some of the contributions by students, but some of it didn't make it back in.
    - mix: I'd love to offer to how to use git collaboratively



## Spec Documentation

- language
  - mix: keen to talk with nano
- refactor
  - add intro
  - reframe to (a) append only log first, followed by (b) packets, followed by (c) replication
- how replication is done: grow only set, "want" msgs with round robin (offset), mainchain pkts and sidechain pkts
  - nano: has notes, has been working on diagrams
  - nano: really just need a meeting with CFT? we have an easter holiday that might be easy, evening for CFT, noon-ish for nanomonkey
    - topic: replication part of the spec
    - time:
      - WELLINGTON, New Zealand 7:00a	Fri, Apr 18 2025
      - BASEL, Switzerland 9:00p	Thu, Apr 17 2025
      - SAN FRANCISCO, United States, California 12:00p	Thu, Apr 17 2025

## Device Support

- nano: any progress on the sx1262 for TBeam?
  - cft: none yet, very keen to progress past this obstacle, maybe after spec work
  - cft: I don't have a TBeam running sx1262, so hard to debug, maybe should buy one
- nano: how to we manage storage filling up on TBeams? SD card? rolling window? --> let's brainstorm once the replication spec is cleaned up
- cft: hoping adding the t5 support will enable people to tinker even more, this is why I'm pioritizing this atm

## Afterparty - mix + nano discuss spec terminology

re: https://github.com/tinySSB/tiny-ssb-spec/issues/8

Mix's sketch
- feed:
  - each device has publishes "messages" as an append-only log, a linear DAG.
  - feed_id: each feed has a unique ID which is the public key used for signing each message in it's feed.
- message:
  - a message is an entry in a feed
  - each message is signed with the feed's public key (see feed_id)
  - messages may be of fixed or variable length payload
  - messages are mapped to "wire packets" for replication
  - messages that are too big to pack into a single LoRa packet are split over multiple packets
  - NOTEs:
    - a message is not necessarily "materialized", it's more a group of packets
    - 

Nano's sketch:
- Feed, which has an id (feed-id)
made up of messages (message-id), which are made up of packets...single packet messages, or multi-packet messages
- messages are signed


Mix exploring how to describe what a "message" is:

```
A <-- B <-- C <-- D
```

```js
// B as a "message" ... not necessarily materialized
// WARNING - this is a sketch and very made-up!
const message = {
  feed_id,
  sequence,
  signature,            // e.g. abc123
  payload,
  next_dmx,             // next msg_link
}
```

```js
// B as wire packets

const main_chain_packet = {
  dmx,
  packet_type,
  payload,
  signature,            // e.g. abc123
}

const side_chain_packet = {
  payload,
  hash,
}
```

We kinda agreed this concept of "message" is very conceptual and hard to point to right now.
We decided to perhaps try and each do a sketch with terminology in mind (no duplication, no vauge terms, clear progression/ layering of context?).
