# tinySSB - spec hacking | 2025-05-01

present: nanomonkey, mixmix

Agenda:
- [x] the "arc"/ order of the story in the spec
- [ ] type 1 messages signature
  - does it cover the whole messages content, or just the first chunk on main chain
- [ ] figure out the tone for the spec
- [ ] get [rough replication notes](https://github.com/tinySSB/meetings/blob/main/2025_04_17-wire_spec.md) into spec

## Arc of the Story

### Proposal A: 

1. Links to Context paper and BIPF with brief intro
2. Describe GOSET
   - introduces Feeds (append only log), 
   - feed_id (public key encryption), signing messages
   - GOSET, grow only set crdt concept
   - introduce DMX, and CLAIM messages
   - Novelty message (remove??) 
   - Zap messages (remove??)
3. Feed Messages
    - WNT vector messages for getting missing main Feed messages
    - CHNK vector messages for getting missing side chain messages
    - Main chain packet description
    - Side-chain packet description
4. Peer Neighborhood messages 
    - Ping request (Loramesh only)
    
Pros:
  - links out to other context + specs
  - introduces terminology just-in-time (and in order of dependency)

Cons:
  - some overlap with context paper
  - side-chain messages quite inter-twined with chunks
  - couple the replication protocol/dance with packets/feeds

Noticings:
  - we take a lot as given/read
    - feed_id IS public key is a surprise to some people
    - owning your own "identity" is novel to many
    - signing


### Proposal B: Spiral story

- simple pass
  - peers replicating state
  - the state is ...
  - the replications is dance like...
- wire packets
  - all coordination is done via these
  - here's the sorts and what they do
- the log
  - here's the log structure
  - here's the wire packets and how they fit into the log

Pros
  - like the simple-pass intro
    - tho similar to context papers
    - could get rid of some of the overlap

Cons
  - don't think we should go into "building up state"
    - mix: I was thinking to go VERY high level, meaning our logs
    - nano: we can't discuss higher-order state like "number of votes" without getting into message_ids and feed_ids ... it would be good to revisit how we do that efficiently
  - needs more detail to comment on this one more
    
Noticings
  - no easy way to reference others messages in tinySSB
    - in SSB when you reply to a message you reference messages you're replying to
    - mix: we should revisit this before implementing this
    - nano: I wonder if there is a light + reliable to do this
    


### Proposal C: Listening first (divorce log + replication)

Part 1: building a log
- simple pass: append only log
- medium pass: we support some side chains for some stuff!
- complex pass:
  - here's how you build it up given incoming wire packets
  - details on all the packet types, chunks
  - GOTCHA: you need to know a feed_id to be playing with DMX
  

Part 2: replication
- simple pass: requesting updates
- medium pass:
  - we coordinate who we're talking about
  - then we share our current state
  - then peers send updates
- compelx pass:
  - goset, claims
  - wants

Pros
- decouples replication protocol + log

Cons
- this relies on
  - you getting the feed_id somehow?
  - the messages coming in starting at seq 1 (first message)
- starts with a more dynamics/ complex DMX
- if the very first message is a side chain message... more complication




Noticings

### Proposal D: 

0. intro (simple pass from B)
1. replication of main feed
  - GOSET concept
  - claim messages => building a shared GOSET
  - want messages => setting up replication / request
2. feeds (like proposal C part 1)
  - the anatomy
  - messages
  - special case: want messages for chunks

Noticings
- mix: there are want messages for CHUNKS, what!
- we could bundle "type 1" messages in their own section...
- nano: (future idea) the case of payload less than < 48 bytes
  - `type: 0` = exactly 48 bytes payload
  - `type: 1-47` = payload is length 1-48 bytes (padded out to 48 after that?)
  - `type: 48` = the new "type 2", as in you need to look up what type 48 means in a spec
  - `type: 255` = sidechain message (more than 48 bytes)
  - lot of discussion here
    - we agree side-chains need some work
    - nano points out with can use DMX_PREFIX to introduce breaking changes
    - mix is keen to leave space for evolution / new features here (minor non-breaking changes)
    - needs more discussion
  
MIX & NANO feeling really good about this one


## Actions

mix
- [ ] go research type 1 message signatures, and report back to Nano

nano
- [ ] send mix some possible time
