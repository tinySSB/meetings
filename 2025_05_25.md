## Updates

Nanomonkey
- fried the power chip on my new T5 D:
  - not sure exactly where the damage is, likely battery management chip.
  - working on replacing parts / re-ordering

Mix
- playing with a Meshtastic device, reports about reach
  - learning about noise, the community has gone to ShortFast to handle too many peers
  
  
## Spec writing

Question
1. how do we review?
  - a) details
  - b) language
    - feed vs log
    - packet / message / vector
    - what's the message? --> why not use "payload" instead of message?
      - payload vs content
      - 
    - from networking: a packet has fields, one is the payload field
2. test vectors?


Other topics discussed:
- lets work more async
    - in person meetings are not being used that effectively
    - idea: try to post work 3+ days out from meeting, ask for a review
    - idea: move to actively using more written / async comms, giving time to process
- tour of Github PR features
    - how to reply inline
    - "resolving" inline comment threads
    - viewing a preview of MD files
- test vectors
    - CFT presented formatting
    - we discussed where we might put them => ultimately in the spec repo
    - for now, work in github issue while spec settles down
    - idea for order we produce them
        - review spec, use this to map "stepping stones" where a simple test-vector could help ensure a person building following the spec could benefit from confirming their logic
        - add these "main paid" test-vectors
        - add more complex test vectors (e.g. edge cases, fully worked scenarios) as required later


## Actions

- Nanomonkey and CFT will review Mix's PR, and give comments when each is able (CFT is in the middle of Finals)
- CFT will do a first pass of test vectors, working on the initial message packet, and then later will work on producing "scenarios" of back and forth between peers
