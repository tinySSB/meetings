## Updates

Nanomonkey
- met with mix and read around the want code in python
- solo reading of python + C code  to understand the goset + want + chunk wire protocol
    - found something in C that's not in Python : "zap"? ... could be LoRa specific timing thing but gonna make an issue to track
- have a lot of little things I'd like to ask CFT about
    - sorting the feeds for goset (numerical? alphanumerical?)
    - little/ big endian in different places
    - max of 100 keys in goset?
    - not sure of algorithm of taking 2 "claims" and working to surface "novel" feeds
    - python code doesn't seem to have anything but side-chains (`write` used, never `write48`)?
    

Mix
- met with nanomonkey (same as above)
- opened a DRAFT "want" PR on the spec
