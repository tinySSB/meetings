## Updates

### tremola4Chrome

- mini app implementations in TremolaApp
- interested in porting this over to the Chrome env (backend-less env)
  - better development
- here's a demo
  - showed mini app examples
  - showed dev env where state progression could be seen
- mini app state
  - 


Questions
1. Is it useing something specific which binds it to Chrome?
  - Firefox + Safari may have APIs for this, not sure.
2. What are you working on right now, and what's next?
  - finish working on this
  - figure out how to merge this with the code 
    - keen to find a clear home for this
    - consolidate the documentation
3. repo home?
  - https://github.com/orgs/tinySSB/repositories
4. Mix: I'm interested in making a modular JS API to decouple the back end
  - there are challenges around namespacing of the front end UI + state
  - 


### spec work

Been going through the Python, C, Kotlin pulling the specs for the wire protocol

We still have a few things we don't quite understand
- Zap functionality? _cft: this is/was the beginning of remote resource management, plan was to be able to reset a test network in case of corrupted logs, or restart a timed experiment - but it's not really taken care off, just old code fragments_
- 
- raised several issues
- 

Needs review + locking in a version 0.1.0
- test vectors
- stabilise reference from which we can iterate
- timeline - May sometime?
    - optimistic: start May
    - pessimistic: end May


### new HW devices

- T5
  - esp32 device with eInk display
  - got some devices
  - have been hacking on toolchain
- TWR
  - VHF frequency band
  - implemented the modem - 800 bit/s

### game-state-sync over append-only-log

for tic-tac-toe
- wrote up a 2 page
- complex game state - many pathways
- formal proof of complex state machine

questions
1. is this a CRDT?
  - we don't think so
2. could this be split into several simpler state machines?
  - possible, would be very interested




## Actions

CFT
- [ ] make a repo for Tremola4Chrome
- [ ] add Adam as Admin for that repo

Mix
- [ ] book a call around front end state + APIs with CFT + Adam
- [ ] book in call for Spec for next week
