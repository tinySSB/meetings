- [x] SSB poll spec
- [x] spec work
  - [x] test vectors
- [ ] T5

T5: https://lilygo.cc/products/t5-4-7-inch-e-paper-v2-3

## Updates

Mix:
- spec work: had a call with Nano, agreed on an arc
  - questions:
    - LogId vs FeedId (naming question)
    - type 1 message signature << still TODO /cft asks back: why should there be a difference, wrt type 0?/
      - CFT: you only sign over the main-chain packet, _verification_ is all on the main-chain packet, no side-chain packets needed
      - Nano: I thought you said you needed the side-chain for something - next DMX/ sig?
      - CFT: no we designed it so you don't 
      - CFT: to _construct_ the signature you need to have already chunked up (this defines what's in the main chain bit)
- rust implementation: started with Piet
  - repo: https://github.com/tinySSB/tiny-ssb-rs
  - questions
    - test vectors
    - where is bipf getting used
- had a play with a SenseCAP T1000e
  - started organising buying locally: https://mixmix.nz/p/poneke-mesh/

Kevin
- still interested to know how I can help

Nanomonkey
- Common LISP implementation
  - questions
    - timing of messages
  - repo: not yet
- playing around with T5
  - MIX: does it have a case?
    - Nano: yes, I don't know how to get it off
  - power
    - battery: 1500mAh
    - 88mA while running => 9-10 hours active use
    - powering - wireless or USB
  
CFT
- T5
  - working on input
    - UI update is currently quite slow (0.5-2s)
  - similar to T-watch
  - this device is a full peer (can author it's own messages)
  - writing the apps here in C++ (not JS)
  - it can still behave as a relay still
  - repo at https://github.com/tinySSB/esp32-firmware/tree/cft-T5s3pro



## SSB Poll Spec

CFT: I saw the message, had some questions
  - inspired by Loomio, what is important? (pollSSB spec says "data model")
    - Mix: probably more about the vote styles


## Spec

work to do
- re-order the spec         << mix + nano
- finalise terminology
- test vectors
- proof reading / user-testing
- language/env set:
  [x] C++
  [x] Py
  [ ] Kotlin
  [x] Rust
  [?] JS

Nano:
- propose we follow the spec arc
- GoSET as first case to study? Then main log entries, then sidechain pkt (chunks), then "apps"


### Vectors

- name what we're testing << nano + mix
- how we're encoding them << coordination
  - CFT: prefer to have a hex encoding (s-expressions from Rivest: #11223344# for a byte array)
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression
    - https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-rivest-sexp-01.html (2023)
  - Nano: I think it should be inline in the docs
  - Mix: parts I think we want
    - description
    - input data (feed_id_1, feed_id_2, ...)
    - expected output data (xor, highest_feed_id)
- make them
- have everyone test them


## ACTIONS / TODO

CFT
- [ ] produce some GOSET test-vectors (probably: from 0 to 5 FeedIDs), put them in a branch of the spec repo

Nano + Mix
- [ ] working on the spec!
- [ ] getting test-vectors requests to Christian

Mix
- [ ] call with Kevin running through the protocol

Kevin
- [ ] Proof reading the spec
